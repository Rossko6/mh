<h1> Ross Nicol's Mini Project 6 </h1> 

<p> For this project I decided to share a video I made a few years ago for one of my soccer players. This game was a US Youth Soccer National Semi Final and the game was streamed live and uploaded to Youtube.  I then dowloaded the video to my desktop and used i-Movie for all the transitions and effects. I kind of self taught myself to make this video and I remember putting a lot of time in to it.  This is something I want to improve on and use for other soccer players I work with.</p>
